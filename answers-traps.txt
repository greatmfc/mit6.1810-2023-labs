1. The registers that contain arguments to functions are a0–a7 and fa0-fay, which is specified in page 2, 18.2, riscv-calling.pdf.
   The register a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf.

2. In line 46, address 26, the function f was called and inlined. The call to g is in line 32, address 14 which is also inlined.

3. The function printf is located at address 630.

4. The value in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main is 38(the address just after the instruction). Because the address of the instruction following the jump
(pc+4) is written to register ra when the jalr instruction is executed. (Page 39 and 140, riscv-spec-20191213.pdf)

5. The output is "He110 World". i should be set to 0x726c6400 if it is big-endian. Don't need to change 57616 because it is in fact outputting the hexadecimal representation of the value which is not effected by the sequence of bytes stored in a computer’s memory.

6. A random number is printed after 'y='. Because the caller didn't provide enough argument for printf. It has to locate the subsequent memory address for its second argument, which is an undefined behavior in c++.

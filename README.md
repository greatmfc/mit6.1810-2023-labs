# mit6.1810-2023-fall solutions

This is a repository that contains personal solutions to the 6.1810 course labs.

Probably won't be updated anymore.

Feel free to look up solutions between branches. All of those have pass the grading with full credits. But some might have extend the timeout value in order to make sure it can finish all tests before the testing process terminates it due to long duration.
